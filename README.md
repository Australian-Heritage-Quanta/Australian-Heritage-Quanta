- 👋 Hi, I’m @Australian-Heritage-Quanta- 🌱 I’m currently learning the HOLLYWOOD SCRIPT FORMAT. DIRECTING for FILM & TV. And - Using my Olympus EM5 MkII for Historical photography of communities & events.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with my EDITOR to BE on a THREE HOUR EPIC as a MASTERWORK for a JACK THOMPSON.
- 📫 How to reach me:  AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE QUANTA, 
- 😄 Pronouns: ...BLUEY, MR QUILTY, MAJOR QUILTY, SIR, MATE. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... "BLUEY" emerged as a nick name in countries where redheaded SCOTS & IRISH men would get into fights and wind up "BLACK & BLUE"  
  But... it may go all the way back to the Iberian Peninsula where Spain is today. Back then the Galaecian ancestors of the modern Irish went into battle with their hair dyed blue with lime paste.
